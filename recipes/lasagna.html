        Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly.
        Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent.

        garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
    </li>
    <li><b>Cook the noodles:</b>
        Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly
        salted water until they're al dente.
    </li>
    <li><b>Make the cheese layer:</b>
        Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs,
        the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.
    </li>
    <li><b>Assemble the lasagna:</b>
        Layer the ingredients according to the recipe
        (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella)
        until the lasagna is assembled.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    In an oven preheated to 375 degrees F,
    this homemade lasagna should be perfectly baked in about 50 minutes
    (30-40 minutes covered, 5-10 minutes uncovered).
